Rust utilities for validating in-app purchases (IAP) made through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, and parsing server-to-server change notifications (for refunds, subscription cancellations, etc.).

This util is specifically written to handle purchase events from Flutter apps (with Flutter's `in_app_purchase` package), but could probably be made to work for other front-ends.

This code is provided as-is. For the time being, attention will not be given to backwards compatibility or clear documentation. It is open-sourced mainly for the chance that snippets may be useful to others looking to do similar tasks. Eventually, this may become a real library productionized and documented for external use.
